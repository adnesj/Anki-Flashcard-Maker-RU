# Anki-Flashcard-Maker-RU

A simple script I made to automatically create flashcards for anki by scraping necessary information from Wiktionary, Openrussian, and Bing images. Only works for russian so far, but it would be possible to adapt it to work for any language of your wish. Apologies for the incredibly messily written code, I am not a very good programmer yet.

Main file is in main.py, and the setup of my anki cards for this to work in anki_card_template.txt.
